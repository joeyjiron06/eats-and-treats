## Teance

### Berkeley, CA

We were in Berkeley for the afternoon and Joey couldn’t leave without stopping at Teance. It’s a high-end, yet relaxing, shop selling a variety of teas and supplies. They have a tasting bar and an upstairs area with tables where you can kick back with a book or some work and enjoy a pot of tea.  We went for the burnt sugar black tea, which runs $7 for a pot. They serve all tea pots with a kettle of hot water so you can refill to your heart’s desire.  I lost count of the number of cups we drank, but I left satisfied and slightly over-caffeinated.
